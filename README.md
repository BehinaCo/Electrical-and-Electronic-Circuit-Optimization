# Electrical and electronic circuit optimization
This project is dedicated to the optimization of electrical circuits and components using evolutionary and heuristic algorithms incorporated with SPICE.
We provide Optimer which is a user graphical interface for circuit design and optimization.
To use Optimer, first make an account with https://www.circuitoptimization.com and then download the setup file and run it to install Optimer on your system. Optimer works in Windows operating system. After installation, using site credentials, login to the application and follow the steps below to create new optimization project:


1- Optimer: File -> New -> Project

   Create or choose a folder to store optimization project. After that, a new window will be appeared.
   
   
2- Netlistor:

   a) Choose and set NSGA2 options and parameters;
   
   b) Choose HSPICE simulator address;
   
   c) Create or choose main circuit netlist file;
   
   d) Choose or create report file;
   
   e) Set circuit parameters;
   
   f) Set optimization objectives;
   
   g) Save the created state;
   
   h) Run optimization.
   
   
3- Investigate the optimization results

   Look at report file and sort data according to your need to find best results which suit your circuit objectives.
